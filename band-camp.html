    <h1>First day of Band Camp</h1>
    <h3>7/29/24, thanks for stopping by</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Today was the first day of band camp!</p>
    <p>Band camp is basically where we learn how to march and play songs at football games.</p>
    <p>My morning started pretty crazy. I think allergy season is starting again or something cuz i was so allergy.</p>
    <p>It started at 8 am but we wanted to leave at 7:30, so when i half woke up at 6:40 ish then i just fully woke up.</p>
    <p>Had to make a sandwich and stuff for lunch later.</p>
    <p>The camp lasts from 8 am to 3 pm this whole week. Basically like a school day.</p>
    <p>And so I went. It began in silence; literally just the background music as everyone looked around and sat still.</p>
    <p>Some people were LATE so we had to wait on them.</p>
    <p>Well so i kinda forgot all that happened lol, but we basically just played the songs, went outside to learn basics of marching and then played the songs more.</p>
    <p>Also shoutout to our cadence GO TIME at <a href="//freedrumlinemusic.com/sheetmusic/pdfs/gotime.pdf"></a></p>
    <p>Well it was pretty fun and good, rough start for me on the new songs but they seem like i can pick up on it if i practice a little more.</p>
    <p>School starts litrally a couple weeks from now, isn't that crazy</p>
    <p>You know we were supposed to download this "BAND" app but it's really sus so im not getting it</p>
    <p>This is my first like really into-it 'ekahi so far.</p>
    <p>So yeah, band camp was pretty solid even though our outside tent almost flew away lol.</p>
