    <h1>Origin of Hilo's Name</h1>
    <h3>7/28/24, thanks for stopping by</h3>

    <p>Hilo's name might sound like it just popped into my head, but it's actually more than that.</p>
    <p>You see, I recently went to Hawai'i, and ever since then, I've been inspired by the language and stuff</p>
    <p>The original idea for this website was to have my posts and user posts (what i considered wiki posts). Wiki comes from Hawai'ian <i>wikiwiki</i>, which means fast. Since i'm silly, i took the opposite of fast (slow) and translated it back to Hawai'ian. That's "lohi".</p>
    <p>"Lohi, lohi..." I thought. It was a solid name, but i could make it better.</p>
    <p>I decided to try switching the lo and hi. Hilo. Usually I would just brush "Hilo" off as a dumb meaningless thing, BUT...</p>
    <p>Hilo is a region in Kona (the Big Island of Hawai'i). The other popular region in Kona? Kailua. What does Kailua mean? Two. How many aspects does this website have? Two!</p>
    <p>So then I decided Hilo was a great name. My posts are called 'ekahi which means one in Hawai'ian and the user's posts are called Kailua.</p>
